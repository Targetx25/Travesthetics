# Travesthetics

Travesthetics is a dynamic, location-based travel recommendation website that suggests the best places to visit based on your current city and the type of outingâ€”be it a family trip, a romantic date, or a fun excursion with friends. The app integrates the GeoApify API to fetch local attractions and uses ExpressJS for the backend, along with EJS templating for the frontend.
